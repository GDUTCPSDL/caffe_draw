Requirements:
    Python 2.7.x

First Step:
    Generate log file when training:
        e.g.: 
        $TOOLS/caffe train --solver=$SOLVERFILE 2>&1 |tee out.log

Second Step:
# cd /path/to/your/caffe/
# git clone https://github.com/GDUTCPSDL/caffe_draw.git

Modify draw/draw.sh
# chmod +x ./caffe_draw/draw.sh
# ./caffe_draw/draw.sh

Then you will find graphics in the directory where log file is.
